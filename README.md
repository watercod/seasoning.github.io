# Getting your own copy
The easiest way is to just fork the repo and then rename it to `your_username.github.io` and then the URL for your copy will be the name of your fork. Note that this won't auto-update to any new commits to this repo, so you will have to fetch upstream each time you want to update.

Obviously you can also just download the files and set it up yourself with some kind of web server but that takes a lot of work if you've never done it before.

# Contributing
If you want to add games, then go to `/other/sidebar.html`. This contains all of the data for all of the games. It's pretty self explanatory as to what all the things you will have to specify are. Note that flash games do not need the `data-frameheight` and `data-framewidth` attributes. All of the flash game files are stored in a different repo, this can be found at my profile under `ellieeet123/swf`. Just place any game files you want to add in the folder named `swf`
